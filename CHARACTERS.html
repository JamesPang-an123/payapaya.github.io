	<img src="D:\Users\User\Downloads\564ad7faa73dd05302f17e62f265fe2a.jpg" class="haha">
<br>
			
		<p>  Hanamichi Sakuragi is the main protagonist in the series. As a power forward he plays for Shohoku High School Basketball Team. Even more, Hanamichi is very rude and thinks himself best without any skills. The reason he hates basketball 
		  is that the 50th girl who rejected him was in love with the basketball player. 
		  Later, he gets into basketball for Haruko Akagi with whom he falls in love.

		<p> Takenori Akagi is the captain of the Shohoku basketball team. Furthermore, 
		   he is the brother of Haruko Akagi. Because of having an average player on his team, 
		   he was doing everything alone. But In his 3rd year, Hanamichi Sakuragi joins the team. 
		   Though, Hanamichi was a beginner his ability to jump high provided an advantage for the team. 
		   The scholarship provided to him was also stopped as he lost to Aiwa. As a result, he has to give normal exams.
